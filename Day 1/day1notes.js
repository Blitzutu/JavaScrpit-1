var a = 5;
var b = 6;
var c = a + b;
var n1 = 123;
var n2 = 123.4;

// Booleans
var test = true;
var test = false;

// array lets you store multiple data peices in one spot
var a =[];
var colors = ["red","green","blue"];
// to target red would use colors [0] as it starts at 0

// Objects - Let you store almost any type of data and how it looks and is stored
var a ={};
var car ={name: "Volkswagen", color"blue", price:550};
// to target just the color of that i would write it as
car.color

// Null / Undefined
// it is a Variable without any data stored in it yet.
// to reset to default var test = undefined; or test = undefined;
// undefined and null are different, null is a purposeful "nothing" syntax whereas undefined is just empty.
